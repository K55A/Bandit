### I. Connect:
```sh
ssh -p 2220 bandit@bandit.labs.overthewire.org
Password: bandit0
```
### II. My solution:
- Make sure that the readme file is actually in the folder.
```sh
bandit0@bandit:~$ ls
readme
```
- Use 'cat <file>'  command to read the content in readme file:
```sh
bandit0@bandit:~$ cat readme 
NH2SXQwcBdpmTEzi3bvBHMM9H66vVXjL
```



### III. Result:
Password for 'bandit1' user: NH2SXQwcBdpmTEzi3bvBHMM9H66vVXj.
